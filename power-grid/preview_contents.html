			<h4>Info</h4>
			<p>Power Grid will be played per the printed rules from Rio Grande Games. 2F's FAQ is located here: http://www.2f-spiele.de/spiele/faq/faq_frames_eng.htm</p>
			<p><b>Money should be hidden, but must be kept on table!</b></p>
			<h6>Setup</h6>
			<p>5-player games use five of the six board regions and 4-player use four of the six; these regions are selected by each player in player order (randomly determined). There is some bad wording in the rulebook and here is how it shall be handled: each player in turn order selects a region they want to be "in play"; you can select any region with the caveat that all regions must be contiguous when the last player selects.</p>
			<h6>Example</h6>
			<p>5-player game on the Italy board. P1 choose the brown boot section, P2 selects the Green northern region, and P3/P4/P5 must choose Yellow, Red, and Purple. This will help speed setup for some boards.</p>
			<p>We will use 5-player games by preference, resorting to 4-player games if necessary based on the number of players.</p>
